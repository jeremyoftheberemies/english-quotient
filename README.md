# English Quotient Website

HTML + CSS website for English Quotient, Anila Kaveri's Business English training company based out of Toronto.

The website has been optimized for mobile, and has not yet been built out for other sizes. The design focuses on a single service offering (5-week Business English program, $685 CAD, groups of 5 professionals) with Calendly integration. The conversion flow prioritizes credibility building, social proof, and risk reversal to drive mobile users from landing to booking their complimentary onboarding class.
